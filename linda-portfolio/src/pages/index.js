  Hello, I am Linda Zeng. Iâ€™m a student studying Experience Design at Northeastern University. Originally a civil engineering student, I found that I wanted to impact society outside of the built environment. I am greatly interested in engaging and developing different solutions that can benefit many aspects of society.
